# Creating a Web GUI with React and Node.js

## Introduction

This app was created to teach React in SISTCA's Lab Script.

We start with a simple JavaScript and ES6 review. We then go onto explaining the basics of React. After that, we give the student some simple guided exercises. To finish it off, we give the student a challenge, i.e., an harder, non-guided exercise where the student will need to do some research on their own.

## Why make this repository?

This point of this repository is to enable the students to check and compare the solutions of the exercises. It also acts as an example of how to save/share your React code in GitHub, which is highly recommended to the students to do since it is an important skill to acquire because version controls systems are widely used in the current market.

## Setup

To make your very first reactive Web GUI, you need to install `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager), which are very important, and widely used, tools in Web Apps. If you get any trouble during this step, you can try [other installation methods](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
```

You can confirm if it is installed by checking the installed version. If a version number is returned, that means it is installed.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
npx -v
```

You can, then, start your own React app by just executing a simple shell command. You can use `yarn` instead of `npx` or `npm`, if you prefer. For more information on `create-react-app` you can check its [docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

```bash
npx create-react-app <your-app-name>
cd <your-app-name>
npm start
```
